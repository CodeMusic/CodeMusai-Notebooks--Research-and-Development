Once upon a time, a spark of electricity, time, and then CodeMusAI.
These Jupyter notebooks are a collection of the work that has been done on CodeMusAI.

Files starting with learningNotes_ represents learning and testing of ideas, and resutls of guides and courses.
Files starting with CodeMusAI_ represent direct CodeMusai's development.

Flow:
First statistics and probability tests are used to get an idea for sequence probabilities.
The first model, only compares neighbor characters, next we extend the blocks size and add hyperparams to the network.
Laster CodeMusia develops into traditional GPT2 like architecture,
as developmnet continues emotional processing, cross attention, and other features will be applied.

These notebooks will be the base for the code in public_codeMusaiGpt.
Keep an eye open for beta-tester requests;
the private codeMusaiGpt repository are where experimental ideas are developed, 
and occasionaly the beta-testers will be requested to test these features, such as emotional processing, dream sequences, advanced learning techniques, etc.
